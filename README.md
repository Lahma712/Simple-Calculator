# Simple-Calculator

This is a small project written in Python 3.7.
It is a simple calculator. To use it, simply enter 
your calculation by pressing ENTER after each element (number or operator).
The calculation will look vertical.
Write a '=' in order to display the result.

<b>Structure of the input:</b>

number1

operator1

number2

operator2

...

equalsign

result

NOTE: Because of it's simplicity, this calculator does not include operator precedence.
If your calculation includes multiplications or divisions, enter those first, so the calculation
will be correct.

Example:
3*4/2+1-2=5.0
