# Simple-Calculator

This is a small project written in Python 3.7.
It is a simple calculator. To use it, simply enter 
your calculation by pressing ENTER after each element (number or operator).
The calculation will look vertical.
Write a '=' in order to display the result. After a result has been displayed,
the loop restarts and you can enter a new calculation.

<b>Structure of the input:</b>

<em>NUMBER</em>

<em>OPERATOR</em>

<em>NUMBER</em>

<em>OPERATOR</em>

...

<em>EQUALSIGN</em>

<em>RESULT </em>

<b>NOTE:</b> Because of it's simplicity, this calculator does not include operator precedence.
If your calculation includes multiplications or divisions, enter those first, so the calculation
will be correct.

Example:
3*4/2+1-2=5.0
