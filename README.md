# Simple-Calculator

This is one of my first projects written in Python 3.7.
It is very simple calculator. To use it, simply enter 
your calculation by pressing ENTER after each element (number or operator).
The calculation will have a vertical look to it (see example below).
Write a '=' in order to display the result. After the result has been displayed,
the loop restarts and you can enter a new calculation.

<b>Structure of the input:</b>

<em>number</em>

<em>operator</em>

<em>number</em>

...

<em>equalsign = </em>

<b>OUTPUT</b>

<em>result </em>

===================

<b>NOTE:</b> Because of it's simplicity, this calculator does not include operator precedence.
If your calculation includes multiplications or divisions, calculate those expressions seperately. Simply
use the results of those expressions inside your original calculation.
